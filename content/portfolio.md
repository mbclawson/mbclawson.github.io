Below you'll find projects that showcase my work in data engineering.
You'll find examples of pipeline architecture, AWS management, and infrastructure work - stuff I've built to solve real problems or explore new tools. Each project repo includes context on the problem, my approach, and the tech I used.

## AWS Strava Pipeline

**GitHub:** [aws-strava-pipeline](https://github.com/mbclawson/aws-strava-pipeline)

An AWS-based data pipeline that pulls my activity data from the Strava API and loads it to S3 for analysis. The infrastructure is fully managed with Terraform, providing a reproducible and version-controlled approach to cloud resource management. This project demonstrates end-to-end pipeline architecture on AWS, from API integration to data storage, making athletic performance data readily available for downstream analytics and visualization.
