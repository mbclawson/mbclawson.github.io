# Introduction
This is less of a real first post and more like a 'let's get a meta post out there so I have _something_ on my site'.

## The Meta
This website was born out of (finally) having some time between contracts and clients to wander, meander, and roam all as a way to (paradoxically) focus.  Finding a rhythm here has been challenging. However
I'm grateful for the breathing room.  Like a lot of personal/professional blogs, writing will be my way to solidify understanding, work on communication skills, and make sense of what I'm working on.
No way to fake it if I'm writing about it.

## The Hope(s)
My hopes and aspirations aren't all technical.  Here's the shortlist so far:
- Earn the phrase 'I know python'
- Build a better online presence
- Work on the house
- Work on my running/lifting
- Minimize time crying in the shower while learning about data structures and algorithms
- Take the next step in understanding database internals and optimization
- Increase the number of questions I am away from being completely out of my depth about AI

Let's see what we can get done here!
