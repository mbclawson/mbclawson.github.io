# introduction
This is less of a real first post and more like a 'let's get a meta post out there so I have _something_ on my site'.

## the meta
This website was bourne out of (finally) having some time between contracts and clients to wander, meander, traipse, stray, roam.  Finding a rhythm here has been challenging, however
I'm grateful for the breathing room.  Like a lot of personal/professional blogs, writing will be my way to solidify understanding and work on communication skills.
No way to fake it if I'm writing about it.

## the hope(s)
- Earn the phrase 'I know python'
- Build a better online presence
- Work on the house
- Work on my running/lifting
- Minimize time crying in the shower while learning Data Structures and Algorithims
- Take the next step in understanding database internals and optimization
- Maximize the number of questions I am away from being completely out of my depth about AI

Hope y'all enjoy!
