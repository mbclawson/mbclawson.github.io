[r/homelab](https://old.reddit.com/r/homelab) has been on my radar for quite some time.  I can't remember if that's from a post hitting the top 25, or if that's me spending a LOT of time on techy subreddits.  This post will be the first in a series that details my homelab journey - from setup to learning linux to hosting _stuff_.  For now, let's talk about the vision for the homelab and the first steps in getting this thing fired up.
