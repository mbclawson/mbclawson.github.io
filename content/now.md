I'm exploring full-time and contract data engineering opportunities, particularly roles that leverage my Snowflake, dbt, and DataOps expertise. In the meantime, I'm sharpening my Python, cloud, and database skills.

### Learning & Building
- **Python Skills**: Deepening my Python expertise
- **This Site**: Building out this personal site using Hugo to showcase my work and thoughts
- **AI**: Getting some reps in with modern AI tooling â†’ namely Claude Code and MCPs
- **Database Internals**: Solidifying what it _actually_ means to optimize queries and what's happening at the database internals level
