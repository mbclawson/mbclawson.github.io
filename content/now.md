I'm exploring full-time, consulting, and contract data opportunities, particularly roles that leverage my Snowflake, dbt, and DataOps expertise. In the meantime, I'm sharpening technical skills as outlined below.

### Learning & Building
- **Python**: Deepening my command of Python in the context of data engineering
- **Cloud**: Getting more comfortable operating within AWS and managing infrastructure via Terraform
- **AI**: Exploring AI tooling â†’ namely Claude Code and MCPs
- **Database Internals**: Solidifying what it _actually_ means to optimize queries and what's happening under the hood
- **This Site**: Creating a site to showcase my work and thoughts
