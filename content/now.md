Exploring new opportunities in data engineering while sharpening my python, cloud, and database skills.

### Career Focus
Looking for full-time and contracting/consulting opportunities in the data engineering space. Particularly any role that aligns well with my Snowflake, dbt, and DataOps.

### Learning & Building
- **Python Skills**: Deepening my Python expertise
- **This Site**: Building out this personal site using Hugo to showcase my work and thoughts
- **AI**: Getting some reps in with modern AI tooling -> namely Claude Code
- **Database Internals**: Solidfying what it _actually_ means to optimize queries and what's happening at the database internals level
