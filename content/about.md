Hey. I'm Matt Clawson.  I have a _very_ strong aversion to job titles found in the data industry, so just think of me as an engineer who likes to plumb data.

I have a _real_ passion in designing workflows that index on impact and simplicity.  Implementing robust data pipelines,
optimizing query performance, and setting up greenfield data infrastructure are some of my favorite things to do.
