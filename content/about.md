I'm Matt Clawson.  I have a _very_ strong aversion to job titles found in the data industry, so just think of me as an engineer who likes to plumb data.

I have a _real_ passion in designing data workflows that index on impact and simplicity.  I focus on designing and implementing robust data pipelines, optimizing database performance, and creating analytics solutions that create **_real_** value.
