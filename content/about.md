Hey. I'm Matt. I'm an engineer who likes to plumb data and I've spent over 9 years doing it professionally[^1].

My career path has been one of continually shifting left: from reporting roles in finance[^2] to analytics engineering using dbt in various cloud data warehouses to getting more involved with cloud infrastructure.

A constant during this time? _Real_ passion for doing work that indexes on **impact** and **simplicity**. Implementing data pipelines, optimizing query performance, and setting up greenfield data infrastructure are some of my favorite things to do.

## Experience

2024 → 2025 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Staff Analytics Engineer (Contractor)** @ Optomi LLC

Served as primary Snowflake administrator and dbt subject matter expert for an e-commerce client. I created and implemented Snowflake's data governance strategy, monitored alert channels to troubleshoot errors and keep pipelines running, optimized dbt models, and refined CICD processes.

_Highlight:_ Rolled out a complete dbt Cloud project including multi-project considerations, GitLab repository configuration, and Snowflake administration setup to enable the Data Science & Analytics team to expand on their reporting DAG.

---

2024 → 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Senior Analytics Engineer (Consultant)** @ Brooklyn Data Co. (a Velir company)

Designed and deployed end-to-end data pipelines and dimensional models for clients across various industries and company sizes.

_Highlight:_ Saved a client $91,250 annually by optimizing their BigQuery dbt queries with partitioning, clustering, and advanced incremental strategies.

---

2022 → 2023 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Senior Analytics Engineer** @ Drata

Provided analytics support for Product by modeling complex backend application data in Snowflake with dbt.  I was also heavily involved in refactoring legacy dbt DAGs to increase modularity and improve performance.  Completed various project work for all business units: GTM, Customer Success, Sales, and Executive Leadership.

_Highlight:_ Built an end-to-end data pipeline using Terraform, AWS Lambda, an API, Fivetran, Snowflake, dbt, and Census to surface website activity via Slack for Customer Success team outreach efforts.

---

2021 → 2022 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Data Analyst → Analytics Engineer** @ TechnologyAdvice

Supported various business groups by translating stakeholder requirements into dbt models and Tableau dashboards for self-serve analytics.

_Highlight:_ Led our team during a 2-day hackathon where we increased dbt test coverage by 10x and reduced job runtimes by 50%.

## Beyond Work
You can most often find me running trails in Denver's front range, contemplating a rock climbing comeback, or working on the house[^3].

[^1]: Data titles are weird.  You'll see 'analytics engineer' a lot but my work has typically mapped closer to 'data engineer'.
[^2]: You can read that as frantic Excel work.
[^3]: You can read that as rearranging tools on a pegboard.
