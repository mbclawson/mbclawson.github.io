I'm Matt Clawson.  I have a _very_ strong aversion to job titles, but you can think of me as a data engineer through and through.  I have a _real_ passion in designing data workflows that index on simplicity and impact.

Currently, I focus on designing and implementing robust data pipelines, optimizing database performance, and creating analytics solutions that create **_real_** value.
